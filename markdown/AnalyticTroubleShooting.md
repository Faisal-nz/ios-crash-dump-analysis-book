# Analytic Troubleshooting

This chapter discusses a formal technique for solving problems.  The idea is to provide a framework that prompts the right questions to be asked.

It is well known that one should not "use a sledgehammer to crack a nut".  Most problems have a direct and obvious way forward to progress towards their resolution.  As engineers, developers, and testers, we are well acquainted with such problem solving.  This chapter does not concern those types of problems.

There is another less well-known phrase, "when you hold a hammer, everything looks like a nail".  A hammer is best for hammering in nails, and smashing things generally, but not useful for other types of task.  A hammer is a solution to a restricted set of problems.
Furthermore, our way of thinking about problems is framed to the available tools at our disposal.  If we increase the available tools, we can start thinking about problems in different ways, one of which may lead to the answers we desire.

Suppose we had a spanner and a hack saw in our toolbox.  We wanted to remove an old bathroom fitting held in place with rusty bolts.  Using the spanner might not work, due to the bolts not turning.  However, using a hack saw to remove the bolt heads might be a workable next best solution.  Observing an experienced plumber, or mechanic, reveals such tricks of the trade.

In this context we introduce "Analytic Troubleshooting".  This will help us move forwards on problems when the obvious things have already been tried, and we are running out of ideas.
