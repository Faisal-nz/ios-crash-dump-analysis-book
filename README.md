iOS Crash Dump Analysis Book

# Description

The purpose of this repository is to provide the source code and other resources supporting the iOS crash dump analysis book.  The initial intention is to provide the book in two parts, the first part being an introduction, and the second part an advanced book.
The first book would be distributed free.

# Why write this book?

When I look around at colleagues I notice that we all come to app programming from different career paths.  It seemed like everyone else found crash dump fixing burdensome apart from myself.
I came to app programming from the bottom upwards.  I started off as a device driver and kernel engineer and took subsequent jobs in the middleware layer and then lastly in the app layer.
This less trodden route has given me a perspective which I would like to share with other developers and engineers.

# It's already documented right?

There are lots of documents on the specifics of exploring crash dumps, but they exist in a knowledge bubble not connected to the normal app developer experience; they feel alien.
Software engineering concepts can be employed to avoid crashes, and to lessen the pain in finding and resolving them.  I would like shine a light on this aspect of engineering so you can improve your codebase proactively.
Step-by-step guides often seem to make large logical jumps to derive the answer to why an app crashed.  But crash dump analysis is just problem-solving in a specific domain.  There are systematic problem solving approaches that can be applied here.  I have found these helpful in my own work and want to share the insights more widely.

It's my opinion that when you put these three approaches together: software engineering, systematic problem solving, and crash dump exploration you end up with a powerful toolbox you can take with you to any iOS app project.
You will be able to spend less time fixing crashes, and more time writing valuable functionality.  That's something all engineers want!
