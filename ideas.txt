x Explain heuristic concepts before going in examples of each
x Explain the choice of tooling (free = to communicate without prop tooling, just starting out, hopper = paid ios pro, irda = pen tester/rev eng/enterprise)
x Possible to have a website to analyse crashes and promote the book.
x Explain Kepner Tregoe
Explain Mach, mach_msg etc. and History
Do Kepner Tregoe worksheets
Look at structure of iBook and Technical books - need Acknowledgements and Copyright/Trademarks Section
x Look at smashbooks
x Include example of WTFCrash (WebKit)
x Add Preface
x Show opengl crash
x Show Core Foundation crash
x Map out the crashes to how they fit in terms of covering tvos,macos,ios, etc. and languages.

Do indexing for third party crash tools in the tools section
x Look into detail about the ios memory allocator
Consider tvos and watchos - maybe examples of wrong extension number for watchos, find a tvos crash

x Cover chapters for illegal instructions, guard exceptions, and termination codes.

LATER WE SHALL references found from `grep -iR --color later markdown examples`

Examples of using xcode diagnostic tools (e.g. malloc history)
x Using class-dump in an example [Siri Crash]
x Using hopper for pseudo-code
Explain xcode instruments (memory profiler or VM usage)
